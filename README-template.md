## My process

- Added classes to HTML for styling
- CSS
  -- Applied typography elements
  -- Worked with the layout from top to bottom, mobile-first

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Encountered some issues with the image and color application via multiply. Ended up using `background-image` and had a much better time implementing it.

Second issue was the image sizing with the responsive layout. Struggled with the size until I realized there were multiple selectors all adjusting the same element. Better CSS organization in the future should help address this.

### Continued development

Intend to revisit the layout to improve implementation time.
